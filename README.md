# SuperHeroApp
A Kotlin app that consumes SuperHeroAPI and shows Hero Info

Uses:
- MVVM Pattern
- Repository
- Navigation Component
- Kotlin Coroutines
- Retrofit for REST API
- Creates a list on the go, because the SuperHeroApi doesn't have a method that returns a list.
- ViewBinding
- Moshi for Retrofit as converter
- Coil for image load and display
